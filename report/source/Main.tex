    \noindent In the rapidly growing fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science, understanding salary trends and recruitment patterns is increasingly important. This report analyzes the \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aijobs/global-salaries-in-ai-ml-data-science}{\textit{Global Salaries in AI, ML, Data Science}} dataset, containing 57,194 records across 11 variables, to provide a comprehensive overview of compensation patterns. The study covers exploratory data analysis, handling of missing and duplicate entries, outlier detection and treatment, and examination of the probability distribution of salaries. Based on these analyses, the report presents key insights into global salary structures within these domains.

\section{Overview}

This study investigates global salary trends for AI, ML, and Data Science roles, focusing on the factors that influence compensation and enabling predictive modeling. Specifically, we aim to:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item Examine salary patterns across countries and job positions.
    \item Understand how experience, company size, location, remote work, and employee background relate to salary.
    \item Analyze the impact of recent trends in remote work on compensation.
\end{enumerate}

Our analysis is guided by the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How does an employee’s experience level (Entry, Mid, Senior, Executive) affect salary?
    \item Has the rise of remote work, especially post-COVID-19, significantly influenced salaries?
    \item What other factors most strongly drive salary differences?
\end{enumerate}

By conducting this study, we seek to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide clear answers to these questions.
    \item Reveal the relationships between key factors and salary.
    \item Develop a multiple linear regression model to predict salary based on experience, company size, remote work, and other relevant parameters.
\end{enumerate}
